## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- React
- Taildwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Below is an example of how "Tailwind CSS" is used
```css
<div className="bg-white dark:bg-darkBlue w-full mt-6 rounded-2xl drop-shadow-lg flex-col">
```
Below the usage of "prop-type" library 
```js
Links.propTypes = {
    item: PropTypes.object,
    index: PropTypes.number,
    isDarkMode: PropTypes.bool,
};
```

### Continued development

Using Tailwind CSS on this project really challenged me in new ways. It forced me to build the website from a "mobile first" standpoint. I will build all websites mobile first from now on.
